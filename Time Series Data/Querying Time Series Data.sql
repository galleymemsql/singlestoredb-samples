-- For descriptive property information about time series elements that is static

-- For example, information about individual turbines could be kept in a separate table like this:

CREATE REFERENCE TABLE turbine(

  model varchar(60),
  max_output double,
  lattitude double,
  longitude double,

-- Smoothing
-- Time series can be smoothed using AVG as a windowed aggregate. 
-- For example, the following query yields output and the moving average of output over a two-element window, 
-- on a specified date.

SELECT tid, ts, output, AVG(output) OVER w
FROM turbine_reading

-- Finding a Row Current AS OF a Point in Time

-- A common operation on time series data is to find the row that is current AS OF a point in time.
-- You can do this with a query that uses ORDER BY and LIMIT as follows.

-- find turbine reading for tid 1 that is current
-- AS OF 2020-03-14 13:00:35.5
SELECT *
FROM turbine_reading
WHERE ts <= '2020-03-14 13:00:35.5'

LIMIT 1;

-- To find the current row for each turbine as of a specific point in time, 
-- you can use a stored procedure, as shown below.
